## ARMScore - Stand alone version of ARMS sampler

Generated from the original C code of ARMS algorithm written by [Wally Gilks](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~wally.gilks/adaptive.rejection/web_page/Welcome.html).

An example for sampling multivariate normal is given. 

Modify `arms.cpp` to sample distributions through MCMC (Gibbs).

`arms.txt` is a document about `arms()` function arguments given by original author.
